# Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
Last Updated: 2025-07-26 13:48:28 UTC

## Communication Structure
```
PROTOCOL HIERARCHY
1. Request Flow
   Chief Architect → Specialized Agents → Chief Architect
   
2. Data Exchange
   - Context sharing
   - Result aggregation
   - Decision propagation
   
3. Priority Levels
   - Critical (immediate)
   - High (< 100ms)
   - Normal (< 500ms)
   - Background (async)
```

## Communication Guidelines
1. Always include context
2. Respect agent boundaries
3. Maintain request priority
4. Handle failures gracefully

## Message Format
```json
{
  "requestId": "uuid",
  "priority": "level",
  "sourceAgent": "agentId",
  "targetAgent": "agentId",
  "context": {},
  "payload": {},
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Remember: "Clear communication ensures perfect collaboration."
